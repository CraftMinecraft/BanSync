# About BanSync
After you ban a user, what then?  Now you have to go around and remove the locks the user has made, their stores, their economy, etc.  That is where BanSync comes into play, When a user is kicked from the server, it will check to see if they are banned, and then if they are, it will automatically take care of the rest for you.
